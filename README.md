# Poset Type Theory

Experimental Haskell implementation of a version of cubical type theory with a model in presheaves over finite, non-empty posets.
Some additional information can be found in the file located in [`./doc`][path/doc], a PDF version of which can be found [here][doc].


## Setup

The project is built using [cabal][software/cabal].
To install the type checker and evaluator, clone the repository and run `cabal install --overwrite-policy=always`.
This will install an executable called `postt` in `~/.cabal/bin/` (and potentially remove old versions).


## Usage

To see all options use `postt --help`.
To type check all definitions in a file, and evaluate the last one use `postt eval <path>`.
To start a read-eval-print-loop (repl) use `postt repl`.
In the repl, use `:help` to see all available commands.
